Welcome to the 'arduinoEddingPlotter'

Ever thought about creating a printing machine using LEGO parts and Arduino Uno components?
To realize the project you will need:

- Arduino Uno R3 or R4
- 2 stepper motors
- 1 servo motor
- 1 LEGO rail vehicle which runs on LEGO rails
- 50 centimeters of LEGO rails for the pen vehicle to run on the X axis
- 1 conveyor belt for pulling the pen vehicle on the X axis from left to right
- 2 cardboard tubes for holding and spinning the paper
- 2 timing belts for turning the cardboard tubes
- a lot of cables :)
- a breadboard for connections between Arduinon and controllers
- an edding that can be fixed on the vehicle

The code can paint 2 color bitmap images in the "0" and "1" format, where "0" paints a black dot and "1" leaves a white dot
printer can paint images with a maximum sitze of 400 pixels (width) and 250 pixels (height) maybe even a little more.

painting bitmaps can take a lot of time (between 1 and 3 hours depending on size and complexity).
Parameters need fine-tuning (pen distance, lines, with, speeds). You can experiment with

Have fun!
